# javascript-challenge
The main goal of this challenge was to demonstrate a working knowledge of JavaScript. 
The requirements fo this challenge were to create an HTML web page and write code that appends a table to this web page using 
a provided dataset. I then wrote code that searched/filtered through the 'date' column of the table based on user input.
